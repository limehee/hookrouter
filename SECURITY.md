## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Use one of the private channels below:

1. Create a private GitHub security advisory draft:
   - <https://github.com/limehee/hookrouter/security/advisories/new>
2. If advisory creation is not available, contact maintainers privately and include:
   - affected module/version
   - reproduction steps or proof of concept
   - impact summary
   - suggested mitigation (if available)

## Disclosure Process

- The maintainer team will acknowledge incoming reports.
- Impact and exploitability will be validated.
- A fix and disclosure timeline will be coordinated with the reporter.
